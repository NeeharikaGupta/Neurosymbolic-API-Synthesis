If not provided, a `model_init` must be passed.          <Tip>          [`Trainer`] is optimized to work with the [`PreTrainedModel`] provided by the library. You can still use         your own models defined as `torch.nn.Module` as long as they work the same way as the \\ud83e\\udd17 Transformers         models.          </Tip>      args ([`TrainingArguments`], *optional*):         The arguments to tweak for training. Will default to a basic instance of [`TrainingArguments`] with the         `output_dir` set to a directory named *tmp_trainer* in the current directory if not provided.     data_collator (`DataCollator`, *optional*):         The function to use to form a batch from a list of elements of `train_dataset` or `eval_dataset`. Will         default to [`default_data_collator`] if no `processing_class` is provided, an instance of         [`DataCollatorWithPadding`] otherwise if the processing_class is a feature extractor or tokenizer.     train_dataset (Union[`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`, `datasets.Dataset`], *optional*):         The dataset to use for training. If it is a [`~datasets.Dataset`], columns not accepted by the         `model.forward()` method are automatically removed.          Note that if it's a `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` with some randomization and you are training in a         distributed fashion, your iterable dataset should either use a internal attribute `generator` that is a         `torch.Generator` for the randomization that must be identical on all processes (and the Trainer will         manually set the seed of this `generator` at each epoch) or have a `set_epoch()` method that internally         sets the seed of the RNGs used.     eval_dataset (Union[`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, Dict[str, `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, `datasets.Dataset`]), *optional*):          The dataset to use for evaluation. If it is a [`~datasets.Dataset`], columns not accepted by the          `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. If it is a dictionary, it will evaluate on each          dataset prepending the dictionary key to the metric name.     processing_class (`PreTrainedTokenizerBase` or `BaseImageProcessor` or `FeatureExtractionMixin` or `ProcessorMixin`, *optional*):         Processing class used to process the data. If provided, will be used to automatically process the inputs         for the model, and it will be saved along the model to make it easier to rerun an interrupted training or         reuse the fine-tuned model.         This supersedes the `tokenizer` argument, which is now deprecated.     model_init (`Callable[[], PreTrainedModel]`, *optional*):         A function that instantiates the model to be used. If provided, each call to [`~Trainer.train`] will start         from a new instance of the model as given by this function.          The function may have zero argument, or a single one containing the optuna/Ray Tune/SigOpt trial object, to         be able to choose different architectures according to hyper parameters (such as layer count, sizes of         inner layers, dropout probabilities etc).     compute_loss_func (`Callable`, *optional*):         A function that accepts the raw model outputs, labels, and the number of items in the entire accumulated         batch (batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps) and returns the loss. For example, see the default [loss function](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/052e652d6d53c2b26ffde87e039b723949a53493/src/transformers/trainer.py#L3618) used by [`Trainer`].     compute_metrics (`Callable[[EvalPrediction], Dict]`, *optional*):         The function that will be used to compute metrics at evaluation. Must take a [`EvalPrediction`] and return         a dictionary string to metric values. *Note* When passing TrainingArgs with `batch_eval_metrics` set to         `True`, your compute_metrics function must take a boolean `compute_result` argument. This will be triggered         after the last eval batch to signal that the function needs to calculate and return the global summary         statistics rather than accumulating the batch-level statistics     callbacks (List of [`TrainerCallback`], *optional*):         A list of callbacks to customize the training loop. Will add those to the list of default callbacks         detailed in [here](callback).          If you want to remove one of the default callbacks used, use the [`Trainer.remove_callback`] method.     optimizers (`Tuple[torch.optim.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR]`, *optional*, defaults to `(None, None)`):         A tuple containing the optimizer and the scheduler to use. Will default to an instance of [`AdamW`] on your         model and a scheduler given by [`get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`] controlled by `args`.     optimizer_cls_and_kwargs (`Tuple[Type[torch.optim.Optimizer], Dict[str, Any]]`, *optional*):         A tuple containing the optimizer class and keyword arguments to use.         Overrides `optim` and `optim_args` in `args`. Incompatible with the `optimizers` argument.          Unlike `optimizers`, this argument avoids the need to place model parameters on the correct devices before initializing the Trainer.     preprocess_logits_for_metrics (`Callable[[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):         A function that preprocess the logits right before caching them at each evaluation step. Must take two         tensors, the logits and the labels, and return the logits once processed as desired. The modifications made         by this function will be reflected in the predictions received by `compute_metrics`.          Note that the labels (second parameter) will be `None` if the dataset does not have them.  Important attributes:      - **model** -- Always points to the core model. If using a transformers model, it will be a [`PreTrainedModel`]       subclass.     - **model_wrapped** -- Always points to the most external model in case one or more other modules wrap the       original model. This is the model that should be used for the forward pass. For example, under `DeepSpeed`,       the inner model is wrapped in `DeepSpeed` and then again in `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel`. If the inner       model hasn't been wrapped, then `self.model_wrapped` is the same as `self.model`.     - **is_model_parallel** -- Whether or not a model has been switched to a model parallel mode (different from       data parallelism, this means some of the model layers are split on different GPUs).     - **place_model_on_device** -- Whether or not to automatically place the model on the device - it will be set       to `False` if model parallel or deepspeed is used, or if the default       `TrainingArguments.place_model_on_device` is overridden to return `False` .     - **is_in_train** -- Whether or not a model is currently running `train` (e.g. when `evaluate` is called while       in `train`)\",\n          \":mod:`torch.optim` is a package implementing various optimization algorithms.  Most commonly used methods are already supported, and the interface is general enough, so that more sophisticated ones can also be easily integrated in the future.\",\n          \"This is a generic tokenizer class that will be instantiated as one of the tokenizer classes of the library when created with the [`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`] class method.

Args:     model ([`PreTrainedModel`] or `torch.nn.Module`, *optional*):         The model to train, evaluate or use for predictions. If not provided, a `model_init` must be passed.          <Tip>          [`Trainer`] is optimized to work with the [`PreTrainedModel`] provided by the library. You can still use         your own models defined as `torch.nn.Module` as long as they work the same way as the \\ud83e\\udd17 Transformers         models.          </Tip>      args ([`TrainingArguments`], *optional*):         The arguments to tweak for training. Will default to a basic instance of [`TrainingArguments`] with the         `output_dir` set to a directory named *tmp_trainer* in the current directory if not provided.     data_collator (`DataCollator`, *optional*):         The function to use to form a batch from a list of elements of `train_dataset` or `eval_dataset`. Will         default to [`default_data_collator`] if no `processing_class` is provided, an instance of         [`DataCollatorWithPadding`] otherwise if the processing_class is a feature extractor or tokenizer.     train_dataset (Union[`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`, `datasets.Dataset`], *optional*):         The dataset to use for training. If it is a [`~datasets.Dataset`], columns not accepted by the         `model.forward()` method are automatically removed.          Note that if it's a `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` with some randomization and you are training in a         distributed fashion, your iterable dataset should either use a internal attribute `generator` that is a         `torch.Generator` for the randomization that must be identical on all processes (and the Trainer will         manually set the seed of this `generator` at each epoch) or have a `set_epoch()` method that internally         sets the seed of the RNGs used.     eval_dataset (Union[`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, Dict[str, `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, `datasets.Dataset`]), *optional*):          The dataset to use for evaluation. If it is a [`~datasets.Dataset`], columns not accepted by the          `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. If it is a dictionary, it will evaluate on each          dataset prepending the dictionary key to the metric name.     processing_class (`PreTrainedTokenizerBase` or `BaseImageProcessor` or `FeatureExtractionMixin` or `ProcessorMixin`, *optional*):         Processing class used to process the data. If provided, will be used to automatically process the inputs         for the model, and it will be saved along the model to make it easier to rerun an interrupted training or         reuse the fine-tuned model.         This supersedes the `tokenizer` argument, which is now deprecated.     model_init (`Callable[[], PreTrainedModel]`, *optional*):         A function that instantiates the model to be used. If provided, each call to [`~Trainer.train`] will start         from a new instance of the model as given by this function.          The function may have zero argument, or a single one containing the optuna/Ray Tune/SigOpt trial object, to         be able to choose different architectures according to hyper parameters (such as layer count, sizes of         inner layers, dropout probabilities etc).     compute_loss_func (`Callable`, *optional*):         A function that accepts the raw model outputs, labels, and the number of items in the entire accumulated         batch (batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps) and returns the loss. For example, see the default [loss function](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/052e652d6d53c2b26ffde87e039b723949a53493/src/transformers/trainer.py#L3618) used by [`Trainer`].     compute_metrics (`Callable[[EvalPrediction], Dict]`, *optional*):         The function that will be used to compute metrics at evaluation. Must take a [`EvalPrediction`] and return         a dictionary string to metric values. *Note* When passing TrainingArgs with `batch_eval_metrics` set to         `True`, your compute_metrics function must take a boolean `compute_result` argument. This will be triggered         after the last eval batch to signal that the function needs to calculate and return the global summary         statistics rather than accumulating the batch-level statistics     callbacks (List of [`TrainerCallback`], *optional*):         A list of callbacks to customize the training loop. Will add those to the list of default callbacks         detailed in [here](callback).          If you want to remove one of the default callbacks used, use the [`Trainer.remove_callback`] method.     optimizers (`Tuple[torch.optim.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR]`, *optional*, defaults to `(None, None)`):         A tuple containing the optimizer and the scheduler to use. Will default to an instance of [`AdamW`] on your         model and a scheduler given by [`get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`] controlled by `args`.     optimizer_cls_and_kwargs (`Tuple[Type[torch.optim.Optimizer], Dict[str, Any]]`, *optional*):         A tuple containing the optimizer class and keyword arguments to use.         Overrides `optim` and `optim_args` in `args`. Incompatible with the `optimizers` argument.          Unlike `optimizers`, this argument avoids the need to place model parameters on the correct devices before initializing the Trainer.     preprocess_logits_for_metrics (`Callable[[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):         A function that preprocess the logits right before caching them at each evaluation step. Must take two         tensors, the logits and the labels, and return the logits once processed as desired. The modifications made         by this function will be reflected in the predictions received by `compute_metrics`.          Note that the labels (second parameter) will be `None` if the dataset does not have them.  Important attributes:      - **model** -- Always points to the core model. If using a transformers model, it will be a [`PreTrainedModel`]       subclass.     - **model_wrapped** -- Always points to the most external model in case one or more other modules wrap the       original model. This is the model that should be used for the forward pass. For example, under `DeepSpeed`,       the inner model is wrapped in `DeepSpeed` and then again in `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel`. If the inner       model hasn't been wrapped, then `self.model_wrapped` is the same as `self.model`.     - **is_model_parallel** -- Whether or not a model has been switched to a model parallel mode (different from       data parallelism, this means some of the model layers are split on different GPUs).     - **place_model_on_device** -- Whether or not to automatically place the model on the device - it will be set       to `False` if model parallel or deepspeed is used, or if the default       `TrainingArguments.place_model_on_device` is overridden to return `False` .     - **is_in_train** -- Whether or not a model is currently running `train` (e.g. when `evaluate` is called while       in `train`)\",\n          \":mod:`torch.optim` is a package implementing various optimization algorithms.

Args:     model ([`PreTrainedModel`] or `torch.nn.Module`, *optional*):         The model to train, evaluate or use for predictions. If not provided, a `model_init` must be passed.          <Tip>          [`Trainer`] is optimized to work with the [`PreTrainedModel`] provided by the library. You can still use         your own models defined as `torch.nn.Module` as long as they work the same way as the \\ud83e\\udd17 Transformers         models.          </Tip>      args ([`TrainingArguments`], *optional*):         The arguments to tweak for training. Will default to a basic instance of [`TrainingArguments`] with the         `output_dir` set to a directory named *tmp_trainer* in the current directory if not provided.     data_collator (`DataCollator`, *optional*):         The function to use to form a batch from a list of elements of `train_dataset` or `eval_dataset`. Will         default to [`default_data_collator`] if no `processing_class` is provided, an instance of         [`DataCollatorWithPadding`] otherwise if the processing_class is a feature extractor or tokenizer.     train_dataset (Union[`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`, `datasets.Dataset`], *optional*):         The dataset to use for training. If it is a [`~datasets.Dataset`], columns not accepted by the         `model.forward()` method are automatically removed.          Note that if it's a `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` with some randomization and you are training in a         distributed fashion, your iterable dataset should either use a internal attribute `generator` that is a         `torch.Generator` for the randomization that must be identical on all processes (and the Trainer will         manually set the seed of this `generator` at each epoch) or have a `set_epoch()` method that internally         sets the seed of the RNGs used.     eval_dataset (Union[`torch.utils.data.Dataset`, Dict[str, `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, `datasets.Dataset`]), *optional*):          The dataset to use for evaluation. If it is a [`~datasets.Dataset`], columns not accepted by the          `model.forward()` method are automatically removed. If it is a dictionary, it will evaluate on each          dataset prepending the dictionary key to the metric name.     processing_class (`PreTrainedTokenizerBase` or `BaseImageProcessor` or `FeatureExtractionMixin` or `ProcessorMixin`, *optional*):         Processing class used to process the data. If provided, will be used to automatically process the inputs         for the model, and it will be saved along the model to make it easier to rerun an interrupted training or         reuse the fine-tuned model.         This supersedes the `tokenizer` argument, which is now deprecated.     model_init (`Callable[[], PreTrainedModel]`, *optional*):         A function that instantiates the model to be used. If provided, each call to [`~Trainer.train`] will start         from a new instance of the model as given by this function.          The function may have zero argument, or a single one containing the optuna/Ray Tune/SigOpt trial object, to         be able to choose different architectures according to hyper parameters (such as layer count, sizes of         inner layers, dropout probabilities etc).     compute_loss_func (`Callable`, *optional*):         A function that accepts the raw model outputs, labels, and the number of items in the entire accumulated         batch (batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps) and returns the loss. For example, see the default [loss function](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/052e652d6d53c2b26ffde87e039b723949a53493/src/transformers/trainer.py#L3618) used by [`Trainer`].     compute_metrics (`Callable[[EvalPrediction], Dict]`, *optional*):         The function that will be used to compute metrics at evaluation. Must take a [`EvalPrediction`] and return         a dictionary string to metric values. *Note* When passing TrainingArgs with `batch_eval_metrics` set to         `True`, your compute_metrics function must take a boolean `compute_result` argument. This will be triggered         after the last eval batch to signal that the function needs to calculate and return the global summary         statistics rather than accumulating the batch-level statistics     callbacks (List of [`TrainerCallback`], *optional*):         A list of callbacks to customize the training loop. Will add those to the list of default callbacks         detailed in [here](callback).          If you want to remove one of the default callbacks used, use the [`Trainer.remove_callback`] method.     optimizers (`Tuple[torch.optim.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR]`, *optional*, defaults to `(None, None)`):         A tuple containing the optimizer and the scheduler to use. Will default to an instance of [`AdamW`] on your         model and a scheduler given by [`get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`] controlled by `args`.     optimizer_cls_and_kwargs (`Tuple[Type[torch.optim.Optimizer], Dict[str, Any]]`, *optional*):         A tuple containing the optimizer class and keyword arguments to use.         Overrides `optim` and `optim_args` in `args`. Incompatible with the `optimizers` argument.          Unlike `optimizers`, this argument avoids the need to place model parameters on the correct devices before initializing the Trainer.     preprocess_logits_for_metrics (`Callable[[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):         A function that preprocess the logits right before caching them at each evaluation step. Must take two         tensors, the logits and the labels, and return the logits once processed as desired. The modifications made         by this function will be reflected in the predictions received by `compute_metrics`.          Note that the labels (second parameter) will be `None` if the dataset does not have them.  Important attributes:      - **model** -- Always points to the core model. If using a transformers model, it will be a [`PreTrainedModel`]       subclass.     - **model_wrapped** -- Always points to the most external model in case one or more other modules wrap the       original model. This is the model that should be used for the forward pass. For example, under `DeepSpeed`,       the inner model is wrapped in `DeepSpeed` and then again in `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel`. If the inner       model hasn't been wrapped, then `self.model_wrapped` is the same as `self.model`.     - **is_model_parallel** -- Whether or not a model has been switched to a model parallel mode (different from       data parallelism, this means some of the model layers are split on different GPUs).     - **place_model_on_device** -- Whether or not to automatically place the model on the device - it will be set       to `False` if model parallel or deepspeed is used, or if the default       `TrainingArguments.place_model_on_device` is overridden to return `False` .     - **is_in_train** -- Whether or not a model is currently running `train` (e.g. when `evaluate` is called while       in `train`)\",\n          \":mod:`torch.optim` is a package implementing various optimization algorithms.

Adjust the hyperparameters (like epochs, learning rate) as necessary for better performance.\",\n          \"To load images from a folder using PyTorch, you'll want to create a custom dataset by subclassing `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. Given your task is to work with the FashionMNIST dataset, which is built into torchvision, you won't typically need to manually load it from images in a folder. However, I can guide you on how you would create such a dataset class if you were to do it in a more general context.\\n\\nHere's how you can create a custom dataset that loads images from a folder and uses a corresponding label file. This example assumes you have images in a folder and a text or CSV file with labels.\\n\\nFirst, install the necessary libraries:\\n```shell\\npip install torch torchvision\\n```\\n\\nThen you can follow this code to create a custom dataset:\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\\nfrom torchvision import transforms\\nfrom PIL import Image\\n\\nclass CustomImageDataset(Dataset):\\n    def __init__(self, image_folder, labels_file, transform=None):\\n        self.image_folder = image_folder\\n        self.transform = transform\\n        self.image_labels = []\\n\\n        with open(labels_file, 'r') as f:\\n            for line in f:\\n                image_name, label = line.strip().split(',')\\n                self.image_labels.append((image_name, int(label)))\\n\\n    def __len__(self):\\n        return len(self.image_labels)\\n\\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\\n        img_name, label = self.image_labels[idx]\\n        image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, img_name)\\n        image = Image.open(image_path)\\n        \\n        if self.transform:\\n            image = self.transform(image)\\n\\n        return image, label\\n\\n# Define a transform if needed\\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\\n    transforms.Resize((28, 28)),\\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\\n])\\n\\n# Usage\\nimage_folder = 'path/to/images/'\\nlabels_file = 'path/to/labels.txt'\\n\\ncustom_dataset = CustomImageDataset(image_folder, labels_file, transform=transform)\\ndata_loader = DataLoader(custom_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)\\n\\n# Iterate through the data loader\\nfor images, labels in data_loader:\\n    print(images.shape, labels.shape)\\n```\\n\\n### Important Notes:\\n- `labels_file`: It assumes that the labels are stored in a text file where each line contains an image name and its corresponding label separated by a comma, like `'image1.png,0'`.\\n- Transform: It includes resizing to 28x28, which is the size expected for FashionMNIST images and then converts images to tensors.\\n\\n### Using FashionMNIST:\\nIf you specifically want to use the FashionMNIST dataset with a DataLoader, you can directly use torchvision's dataset:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom torchvision.datasets import FashionMNIST\\nfrom torch.utils.data.dataloader import DataLoader\\n\\n# Define the transformation\\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\\n])\\n\\nfashion_mnist_dataset = FashionMNIST(root='data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\\nfashion_mnist_loader = DataLoader(fashion_mnist_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)\\n\\n# Iterate through the FashionMNIST data loader\\nfor images, labels in fashion_mnist_loader:\\n    print(images.shape, labels.shape)\\n```\\n\\n`FashionMNIST` is available directly from `torchvision.datasets`, and using it as shown allows you to focus on your machine learning tasks quickly without having to manage the images yourself.\",\n          \"To complete your task of creating and training a simple linear regression model with TensorFlow on the California housing dataset, I suggest the following usage pattern to use with TensorFlow and related modules. Here's the full code for your task:\\n\\n```python\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\\n\\ndef train_linear_regression_model():\\n    # Load the California housing dataset\\n    housing_data = fetch_california_housing()\\n    X, y = housing_data.data, housing_data.target\\n\\n    # Split the data into training and test sets\\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n    # Standardize the dataset\\n    scaler = StandardScaler()\\n    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\\n    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\\n\\n    # Define the model architecture\\n    model = Sequential()\\n    model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='linear', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))\\n\\n    # Compile the model\\n    model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')\\n\\n    # Train the model\\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=1)\\n\\n    # Evaluate the model\\n    loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)\\n    print(f'Test Loss: {loss}')\\n\\ntrain_linear_regression_model()\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n1. **Data Loading**: The California housing dataset is loaded using `fetch_california_housing()`, which provides you with the features (`X`) and target (`y`).\\n\\n2. **Data Splitting**: Use `train_test_split` to divide the dataset into a training set and a test set.\\n\\n3. **Data Standardization**: To standardize the dataset, I've used `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\\n\\n4. **Model Definition**: A simple linear model is defined using `Sequential` and a single `Dense` layer with one unit, suited for linear regression tasks.\\n\\n5. **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled using the stochastic gradient descent ('sgd') optimizer and mean squared error ('mse') as the loss function.\\n\\n6. **Training**: The model is trained with the `fit` method for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. Adjust the number of epochs and batch size depending on your testing needs.\\n\\n7. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using the test data, and the test loss is printed.\\n\\n### Notes:\\n- TensorFlow provides integration with Keras, so it's easy to build and train deep learning models using the high-level Keras API.\\n- Ensure that you have installed TensorFlow and SciKit-Learn, as they are required for this code to run. You can install them using `pip install tensorflow scikit-learn`.\\n\\nThis code sets up the essential framework, but you can further improve and modify it according to your project's requirements.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["output = []\n","\n","for index, row in df_neural.iterrows():\n","    print(f\"Processing row {index+1}/{len(df)}...\")\n","\n","    try:\n","        prompt = (\n","            f\"Generate complete code that solves the following task using the synthesized API usage pattern:\\n\"\n","            f\"{tasks[index]}\\n\"\n","            f\"{df_neural['neural_gpt']}\\n\\n\"\n","        )\n","\n","        response = make_request_openai(prompt)\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Error generating response: {e}\")\n","        response = f\"Error: {e}\"\n","\n","    output.append(response)\n","\n","    time.sleep(DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Hv6B3gS2wegp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748920841002,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":148275,"user":{"displayName":"Neeharika Gupta","userId":"13434636909198909500"}},"outputId":"f34db040-a6eb-44e3-97f4-9ee3752af340"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Processing row 1/8...\n","Processing row 2/8...\n","Processing row 3/8...\n","Processing row 4/8...\n","Processing row 5/8...\n","Processing row 6/8...\n","Processing row 7/8...\n","Processing row 8/8...\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_results = pd.DataFrame({'final_gpt': output})\n","\n","output_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Stanford NLP/final_generated_code_gpt.csv\"\n","df_results.to_csv(output_path, index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"s5LLqkaGCSdq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748920841027,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Neeharika Gupta","userId":"13434636909198909500"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"IomiqFzsSGZu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
