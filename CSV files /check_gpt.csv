"Based on the task description and standard practices for implementing it using the provided APIs, the following components would likely be used:

1.  `tensorflow`
2.  `tensorflow.keras`
3.  `Sequential`
4.  `Dense`
5.  `fetch_california_housing`
6.  `train_test_split`
7.  `StandardScaler`
8.  `numpy` (used implicitly for array handling)

Referring to the extracted documentation data:

*   `tensorflow`: The documentation covers general import and alias usage (`import tensorflow as tf`), which is standard.
*   `tensorflow.keras`: The documentation covers models (`Sequential`), layers (`Dense`), optimizers, loss functions, and training (`fit`), all necessary for the task. It mentions compatibility between layers and appropriate choices for optimizer/loss for the task. A simple linear regression fits these constraints (e.g., `Dense(1)`, `loss='mse'`, `optimizer='adam'`).
*   `Sequential`: Documentation covers initialization, adding layers (`add`), compilation (`compile`), and training (`fit`). Adding a `Dense` layer is compliant. `compile` expects string identifiers for optimizer/loss. `fit` expects array-like data after compilation.
*   `Dense`: Documentation covers attributes like `units` (positive integer) and the operation. A `Dense(units=1)` for a single output in regression is compliant. `input_shape` should match the feature count.
*   `fetch_california_housing`: Documentation covers loading the dataset, specifying parameters like `return_X_y` to get data and target arrays. This is the standard way to load the dataset for use with scikit-learn/Keras.
*   `train_test_split`: Documentation covers splitting arrays (`X`, `y`) of the same length, which matches the output of `fetch_california_housing` when `return_X_y=True`.
*   `StandardScaler`: Documentation covers initializing the scaler and using `fit_transform` on the training data and `transform` on the test data, ensuring `fit` is called first and feature counts match. This is standard preprocessing for scaled regression.
*   `numpy`: Documentation covers general array handling which is underlying for the data used by scikit-learn and Keras.

The task requires creating a simple linear regression model with one dense layer (e.g., `Dense(1)`), compiling it with an appropriate optimizer and loss for regression (e.g., 'adam', 'mse'), and training it on the California housing dataset which would involve loading the data, splitting it, and scaling it. All steps using the identified APIs, as described in the task, are consistent with the provided documentation constraints for these components.
