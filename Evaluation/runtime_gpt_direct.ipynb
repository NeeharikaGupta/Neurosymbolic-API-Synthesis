You can install PyTorch following the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Other libraries we will use can be installed via `pip` if necessary.\\n\\n### Step 2: Import Required Libraries\\n\\nWe need several libraries from PyTorch for handling datasets, defining models, and training. We will also use torchvision, which provides convenient functions for loading datasets like CIFAR-10 and for common network layers.\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torch.optim as optim\\nimport torchvision\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Data Loading\\n\\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. We\\u2019ll use `torchvision` to load this dataset, applying transformations for normalization.\\n\\n```python\\n# Define transformations for the training and test sets\\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\\n    transforms.ToTensor(),  # Convert images to PyTorch tensors\\n    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))  # Normalize the images\\n])\\n\\n# Load the dataset\\ntrainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\\ntrainloader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=100, shuffle=True)\\n\\ntestset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)\\ntestloader = DataLoader(testset, batch_size=100, shuffle=False)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Define a CNN Model\\n\\nA simple CNN consists of convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers (for down-sampling), and finally, fully connected layers.\\n\\n```python\\nclass SimpleCNN(nn.Module):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()\\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)  # 3 input channels (RGB), 6 output channels, 5x5 kernel\\n        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)  # 2x2 pooling\\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)  # 6 input channels, 16 output channels, 5x5 kernel\\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)  # Linear layer for 5x5 feature maps to 120 outputs\\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)\\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)  # 10 output neurons for 10 classes\\n\\n    def forward(self, x):\\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))\\n        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)  # Flatten feature map\\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\\n        x = self.fc3(x)\\n        return x\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: Define the Loss and Optimizer\\n\\nThe CrossEntropyLoss is typically used for classification problems, and we will use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization.\\n\\n```python\\nnet = SimpleCNN()\\n\\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()  # Loss function\\noptimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)  # Optimizer\\n```\\n\\n### Step 6: Training Loop\\n\\nThe core of the training process involves looping over our data, performing the forward and backward passes, and updating the weights.\\n\\n```python\\n# Training the network\\nfor epoch in range(10):  # Let's train for 10 epochs\\n    running_loss = 0.0\\n    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):\\n        # Get the inputs and labels\\n        inputs, labels = data\\n        \\n        # Zero the parameter gradients\\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\\n        \\n        # Forward pass\\n        outputs = net(inputs)\\n        \\n        # Compute the loss\\n        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)\\n        \\n        # Backward pass and optimize\\n        loss.backward()\\n        optimizer.step()\\n        \\n        # Print statistics\\n        running_loss += loss.item()\\n        if i % 100 == 99:  # Print every 100 mini-batches\\n            print(f'[Epoch {epoch + 1}, Batch {i + 1}] loss: {running_loss / 100:.3f}')\\n            running_loss = 0.0\\n\\nprint('Finished Training')\\n```\\n\\n### Step 7: Model Evaluation\\n\\nAfter training, we evaluate the model on the test dataset to determine its accuracy.\\n\\n```python\\n# Evaluate the network on the test data\\ncorrect = 0\\ntotal = 0\\nwith torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient computation for evaluation\\n    for data in testloader:\\n        images, labels = data\\n        outputs = net(images)\\n        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)\\n        total += labels.size(0)\\n        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()\\n\\nprint(f'Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: {100 * correct / total:.2f}%')\\n```\\n\\n### Step 8: Save the Model\\n\\nFinally, after training, you might want to save the model for later use.\\n\\n```python\\ntorch.save(net.state_dict(), 'cifar10_net.pth')\\n```\\n\\nThere you have the basic steps with a Python script to train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch, including loading data, defining the model, setting up the loss and optimization, training the model, evaluating its performance, and saving it. You can expand upon this by adding features like learning rate scheduling, data augmentation, more complex architectures, and so on, depending on your needs.\",\n          \"To create a custom PyTorch dataset class for loading images and labels from a local folder structure, we need to subclass `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.

Additionally, we assume the images are stored in a grayscale format representative of FashionMNIST.\\n  \\n- `__len__`: Returns the number of images in the dataset.\\n\\n- `__getitem__`: Loads and returns a single image and its corresponding label by applying any transforms defined during initialization.\\n\\n### Step 3: Use the Dataset with DataLoader\\nNow, use this custom dataset class with a `DataLoader` to manage batching, shuffling, and parallel processing.\\n\\n```python\\n# Define transformation\\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\\n    transforms.Resize((28, 28)),  # Resize images to 28x28 pixels\\n    transforms.ToTensor(),       # Convert image to tensor\\n    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))  # Normalization\\n])\\n\\n# Initialize the dataset\\ndataset = FashionMNISTDataset(root_dir='path/to/fashionmnist', transform=transform)\\n\\n# Create a DataLoader\\ndataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)\\n\\n# Iterate through the DataLoader\\nfor images, labels in dataloader:\\n    print(images.size(), labels)\\n    # Here, you'd usually pass the data to your model for training or evaluation\\n```\\n\\n- **Transforms**: Resize images to 28x28 pixels (standard for FashionMNIST) and normalize them. Normalization is typically done based on the dataset's mean and standard deviation.\\n\\n- **Dataset Initialization**: `root_dir` should point to the root of the dataset folder.\\n\\n- **DataLoader**: Initializes with batch size, shuffling (to randomize input order each epoch), and multiple workers for parallel data loading.\\n\\n- **Iterating DataLoader**: The data is now ready to be fed into a neural network model.\\n\\nBy structuring our data pipeline this way, we create a flexible structure that allows simple integration with PyTorch's model training and evaluation workflows.\",\n          \"To create a simple linear regression model with TensorFlow and train it on the California housing dataset, we will follow these steps:\\n\\n1.

If not, use `!pip install tensorflow` in your Jupyter or Colab notebook environment.\\n\\nBelow is a Python function that does this task:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\\n\\n\\ndef create_and_train_linear_model():\\n    # Fetch California housing dataset\\n    cali_housing = fetch_california_housing()\\n\\n    # Convert to Pandas DataFrame\\n    data = pd.DataFrame(\\n        cali_housing.data, columns=cali_housing.feature_names)\\n    labels = pd.DataFrame(cali_housing.target, columns=[\\\"MedHouseVal\\\"])\\n\\n    # Feature selection\\n    feature = 'AveRooms'  # We will perform linear regression with respect to AveRooms\\n\\n    # Split the data: 80% train, 20% test\\n    train_features, test_features, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(\\n        data[[feature]], labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n    # Normalization layer\\n    normalizer = layers.Normalization(input_shape=[1,], axis=None)\\n    normalizer.adapt(np.array(train_features))\\n\\n    # Create the sequential model\\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential([\\n        normalizer,\\n        layers.Dense(units=1)\\n    ])\\n\\n    model.summary()\\n\\n    # Compile the model\\n    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1),\\n                  loss='mean_absolute_error')\\n\\n    # Train the model\\n    history = model.fit(\\n        train_features,\\n        train_labels,\\n        epochs=100,\\n        verbose=0,\\n        validation_split=0.2\\n    )\\n\\n    # Evaluate the model\\n    loss = model.evaluate(test_features, test_labels, verbose=2)\\n    print(f\\\"Test set Mean Absolute Error: {loss}\\\")\\n\\n# Call the function\\ncreate_and_train_linear_model()\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n1. **Fetch the Dataset**: We use `fetch_california_housing()` to get the dataset.\\n\\n2. **Data Preparation**: Convert the dataset into Pandas DataFrame and select one feature for linear regression (`AveRooms`).\\n\\n3. **Normalization**: We use a `Normalization` layer adapted to the `AveRooms` data to standardize the inputs.\\n\\n4. **Model Creation**: Build a sequential model with one normalizer layer followed by a dense layer with a single unit. This setup models a linear regression considering one feature.\\n\\n5. **Compile**: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and Mean Absolute Error as the loss function.\\n\\n6. **Train**: Train the model with 80% of the training data and validate with 20% using the training set.\\n\\n7. **Evaluate**: The model is evaluated on the test dataset.\\n\\nThis function defines a simple linear regression model focusing on a single feature and demonstrates basic usage of TensorFlow's `Sequential` API to perform regression tasks.

Defining them at the top makes it easy to experiment with different values without changing the core logic.\\n3.  **Device Setup:** Training neural networks is computationally intensive. Using a GPU (`cuda`) if available is crucial for performance. This snippet automatically detects and uses the GPU or falls back to the CPU.\\n4.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**\\n    *   We use `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10` which handles downloading and loading the dataset.\\n    *   `transforms.Compose` chains together multiple transformations.\\n    *   `transforms.RandomCrop` and `RandomHorizontalFlip` are common data *augmentation* techniques. They artificially increase the size and variability of the training data, making the model more robust and reducing overfitting.\\n    *   `transforms.ToTensor()` converts images to PyTorch tensors and scales pixel values from \\\\[0, 255] to \\\\[0.0, 1.0].\\n    *   `transforms.Normalize()` scales pixel values based on the channel-wise mean and standard deviation of the dataset. This helps in speeding up convergence and improving performance.\\n    *   `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` is essential. It wraps the dataset and provides an iterable that yields data in batches. This is necessary because training is typically done using mini-batches, which makes gradient estimation more stable than training on individual samples and is more memory-efficient than training on the entire dataset at once. `shuffle=True` for training is important to prevent the model from learning the order of data.\\n5.  **Define the CNN Model:**\\n    *   We create a class `MyCNN` inheriting from `nn.Module`. The `__init__` method defines the layers, and the `forward` method defines how data passes through these layers.\\n    *   **Convolutional Layers (`nn.Conv2d`):** These are the core of the CNN. They apply filters (kernels) to the input image to extract features. `in_channels` is the number of input feature maps (3 for RGB images), `out_channels` is the number of filters (and thus output feature maps), `kernel_size` is the size of the filter (e.g., 3x3), `stride` is how many pixels the filter moves at each step, and `padding` adds zeros around the input borders (useful for controlling output size).\\n    *   **Batch Normalization (`nn.BatchNorm2d`):** Normalizes the output of a convolutional layer across the batch dimension. This helps in training deeper networks by making the training process more stable and allowing for higher learning rates. It's typically applied after the convolution and before the activation function.\\n    *   **Activation Function (`nn.ReLU`):** Introduces non-linearity into the network. Without non-linearities, a CNN would just be a sequence of linear operations, which cannot model complex patterns.\\n    *   **Pooling Layers (`nn.MaxPool2d`):** Reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature maps. This reduces the number of parameters and computation in the network, and helps the network become more invariant to small translations in the input. Max pooling selects the maximum value in a given window.\\n    *   **Flattening:** After the convolutional and pooling layers, the 2D feature maps are flattened into a 1D vector to be fed into the fully connected layers. `x.view(x.size(0), -1)` reshapes the tensor while keeping the batch size the same and automatically calculating the required size for the flattened dimension.\\n    *   **Fully Connected Layers (`nn.Linear`):** These are standard feedforward layers. They take the flattened features and perform classification based on them. The last layer has `out_features=10` corresponding to the 10 classes of CIFAR-10.\\n    *   **Dropout (`nn.Dropout`):** A regularization technique where random connections are temporarily ignored during training. This prevents units from becoming too dependent on each other and helps reduce overfitting.\\n6.  **Instantiate Model, Loss, and Optimizer:**\\n    *   `model = MyCNN().to(device)` creates an instance of our defined network and moves all its parameters to the specified device (GPU or CPU).\\n    *   `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` is the standard loss function for multi-class classification problems. It measures the difference between the model's output logits and the true class labels.\\n    *   `optim.Adam()` is a popular optimization algorithm that updates the model's weights based on the gradients computed during backpropagation. It's often a good default choice. We pass `model.parameters()` so the optimizer knows which parameters to update.\\n7.  **Training Loop (`train_epoch`):**\\n    *   `model.train()` sets the model to training mode. This is important because layers like Dropout and BatchNorm behave differently during training (e.g., Dropout is active, BatchNorm tracks running mean/variance and uses batch statistics) vs. evaluation.\\n    *   We iterate through the `train_loader`, getting batches of `inputs` and `labels`.\\n    *   `optimizer.zero_grad()` clears the gradients from the *previous* training step. Gradients are accumulated by default, so this reset is crucial for calculating gradients correctly for the *current* batch.\\n    *   `outputs = model(inputs)` performs the forward pass, feeding the inputs through the network to get predictions.\\n    *   `loss = criterion(outputs, labels)` calculates the loss between the predicted outputs and the ground truth labels.\\n    *   `loss.backward()` calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to every trainable parameter in the model using backpropagation.\\n    *   `optimizer.step()` updates the model's parameters using the computed gradients and the chosen optimization algorithm (Adam in this case).\\n    *   `loss.item()` gets the scalar value of the loss tensor.\\n8.  **Evaluation Function (`evaluate`):**\\n    *   `model.eval()` sets the model to evaluation mode. Dropout is disabled, and BatchNorm layers use their saved running statistics instead of batch statistics.\\n    *   `with torch.no_grad():` is a context manager that disables gradient calculation. This is important during evaluation because we don't need to compute gradients, saving memory and computation.\\n    *   We iterate through the `test_loader`.\\n    *   `torch.max(outputs.data, 1)` finds the index (class prediction) with the highest probability/logit score along dimension 1 (the class dimension).\\n    *   We compare the `predicted` classes with the true `labels` to count correct predictions and calculate the accuracy.\\n9.  **Run Training and Evaluation:** The main loop iterates for the specified number of `num_epochs`. In each epoch, it calls the `train_epoch` function and then the `evaluate` function on the test set to track performance. It prints the loss and accuracy for each epoch. Saving the model based on the best test accuracy is a common practice.\\n10. **Plot Results:** `matplotlib` is used to visualize the training loss and test accuracy over the epochs, providing insight into the training process (e.g., if the model is overfitting, if the loss is decreasing).\\n11. **Load and Evaluate Final Model:** After training, we load the `state_dict` of the model that achieved the best accuracy during training and perform a final evaluation on the test set to confirm its performance. Loading just the `state_dict` is standard practice as it's more portable than saving the entire model object.\\n\\nThis script provides a solid foundation for training a CNN on CIFAR-10. You can extend it by adding more complex model architectures, different optimizers or schedulers, more advanced data augmentations, logging, etc.\",\n          \"Okay, let's create a PyTorch `Dataset` subclass to load FashionMNIST images and labels from a folder structure, and then use it with a `DataLoader`.\\n\\nSince FashionMNIST doesn't *natively* come as individual image files in class subfolders, we first need a pre-processing step to download the standard dataset and save it in the desired folder structure. Then, we'll build the custom `Dataset` class that reads from this structure.\\n\\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Data Structure**\\n\\nWe want to load data organized like this:\\n\\n```\\nfashion_mnist_folder/\\n\\u251c\\u2500\\u2500 train/\\n\\u2502   \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500 T-shirt_top/\\n\\u2502   \\u2502   \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500 img_00001.png\\n\\u2502   \\u2502   \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500 img_00002.png\\n\\u2502   \\u2502   \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500 ...\\n\\u2502   \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500 Trouser/\\n\\u2502   \\u2502   \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500 img_01001.png\\n\\u2502   \\u2502   \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500 ...\\n\\u2502   \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500 ...

We will use `torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST` to easily download the data and then save it into the target folder structure.\\n\\n*   We'll need to map the integer labels (0-9) from the original dataset to class names (e.g., 0 -> 'T-shirt/top').\\n*   We'll iterate through the training and test sets.\\n*   For each image and label, we'll create the appropriate directory (`root_dir/split/class_name/`) if it doesn't exist and save the image (which is a PIL Image) as a file (e.g., PNG).\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nimport torchvision\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nimport os\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nimport shutil\\n\\n# --- Pre-processing: Save FashionMNIST to Folder Structure ---\\n# This part downloads the data and organizes it into folders.\\n# You only need to run this once.\\n\\ndef save_fashion_mnist_to_folder(root_output_dir='./fashion_mnist_folder'):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Downloads FashionMNIST and saves images into a folder structure\\n    like root_output_dir/split/class_name/image.png\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    print(f\\\"Saving FashionMNIST to folders in {root_output_dir}...\\\")\\n\\n    # Define class names for FashionMNIST\\n    classes = [\\n        'T-shirt_top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat',\\n        'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle_boot'\\n    ]\\n\\n    # Ensure the root output directory is clean or created\\n    if os.path.exists(root_output_dir):\\n        print(f\\\"Removing existing directory: {root_output_dir}\\\")\\n        shutil.rmtree(root_output_dir)\\n    os.makedirs(root_output_dir)\\n\\n    # Download and process training data\\n    train_dataset_original = torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST(\\n        root='./data', train=True, download=True\\n    )\\n    save_split(train_dataset_original, 'train', root_output_dir, classes)\\n\\n    # Download and process test data\\n    test_dataset_original = torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST(\\n        root='./data', train=False, download=True\\n    )\\n    save_split(test_dataset_original, 'test', root_output_dir, classes)\\n\\n    print(\\\"FashionMNIST data saved successfully.\\\")\\n\\ndef save_split(dataset, split_name, root_output_dir, classes):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Saves images from a single split (train/test) to folders.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    split_dir = os.path.join(root_output_dir, split_name)\\n    print(f\\\"Processing {split_name} split...\\\")\\n\\n    for class_name in classes:\\n        os.makedirs(os.path.join(split_dir, class_name), exist_ok=True)\\n\\n    for i, (img, label) in enumerate(dataset):\\n        class_name = classes[label]\\n        # FashionMNIST images are 28x28 grayscale PIL Images\\n        img_path = os.path.join(split_dir, class_name, f'img_{i:05d}.png')\\n        img.save(img_path) # PIL Image save\\n\\n# --- Run the pre-processing step ---\\n# Uncomment the line below to generate the folder structure.\\n# save_fashion_mnist_to_folder()\\n# print(\\\"Please run the save_fashion_mnist_to_folder() function to create the data structure.\\\")\\n\\n```\\n\\n**Reasoning for Pre-processing:**\\n\\n*   `torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST` is the easiest way to get the data initially.\\n*   We need to convert the dataset object (which holds images and labels in memory or arrays) into a *file system* representation.\\n*   Saving as individual image files (like PNG) is a common practice and allows our custom `Dataset` to simulate loading data from scratch, as if it wasn't downloaded via `torchvision`.\\n*   Organizing by `split/class_name/` makes it straightforward for our `Dataset` to determine the label from the file path.\\n*   Using `PIL.Image.save()` is standard for saving image objects loaded or generated by PIL.\\n\\n**Step 3: Create the Custom `Dataset` Class**\\n\\nNow, we define `FashionMNISTFolderDataset` which inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.\\n\\n*   **`__init__(self, root_dir, split='train', transform=None)`:**\\n    *   Takes the `root_dir` (e.g., `./fashion_mnist_folder`), the `split` ('train' or 'test'), and an optional `transform`.\\n    *   It will build a list of all image file paths and their corresponding integer labels.\\n    *   It needs to map folder names (class names) to integer labels (0-9).\\n*   **`__len__(self)`:**\\n    *   Returns the total number of samples (images) in the dataset. This is simply the length of the list of (path, label) pairs created in `__init__`.\\n*   **`__getitem__(self, idx)`:**\\n    *   Takes an index `idx`.\\n    *   Retrieves the image path and label from the stored list at that index.\\n    *   Loads the image file using `PIL.Image.open()`.\\n    *   Applies the `transform` if provided.\\n    *   Returns the transformed image tensor and the label.\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nimport os\\nfrom PIL import Image\\n\\n# --- Custom Dataset Class ---\\n\\nclass FashionMNISTFolderDataset(Dataset):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Custom Dataset to load FashionMNIST images from a folder structure\\n    like root_dir/split/class_name/image.png\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    def __init__(self, root_dir, split='train', transform=None):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        Args:\\n            root_dir (string): Directory with all the split folders (e.g. 'fashion_mnist_folder/').\\n            split (string): 'train' or 'test' indicating the split to load.\\n            transform (callable, optional): Optional transform to be applied\\n                on a sample.\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        self.root_dir = root_dir\\n        self.split = split\\n        self.transform = transform\\n        self.split_dir = os.path.join(root_dir, split)\\n\\n        if not os.path.exists(self.split_dir):\\n            raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"Split directory not found: {self.split_dir}\\\")\\n\\n        # Store class names and create mapping from class name to index\\n        # FashionMNIST classes (sorted alphabetically would match the folder structure)\\n        self.classes = sorted(entry.name for entry in os.scandir(self.split_dir) if entry.is_dir())\\n        self.class_to_idx = {cls_name: i for i, cls_name in enumerate(self.classes)}\\n\\n        if not self.classes:\\n             raise RuntimeError(f\\\"No class directories found in {self.split_dir}\\\")\\n\\n\\n        # Build the list of (image_path, label) pairs\\n        self.samples = []\\n        for class_name in self.classes:\\n            class_dir = os.path.join(self.split_dir, class_name)\\n            if not os.path.isdir(class_dir):\\n                continue # Skip if it's not actually a directory\\n\\n            label = self.class_to_idx[class_name]\\n\\n            for img_file in os.listdir(class_dir):\\n                # Basic check for image files (can be expanded)\\n                if img_file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.bmp', '.gif')):\\n                    img_path = os.path.join(class_dir, img_file)\\n                    self.samples.append((img_path, label))\\n\\n        if not self.samples:\\n            raise RuntimeError(f\\\"No images found in {self.split_dir}.

It requires implementing `__len__` and `__getitem__`.\\n*   **`__init__`:**\\n    *   It finds all relevant image files and stores their paths along with their corresponding labels. This is done upfront to avoid repeatedly scanning the file system during training/inference.\\n    *   It relies on the folder structure: the parent directory of the image file *is* the class name.\\n    *   It creates `self.classes` and `self.class_to_idx` which are standard attributes for image datasets, providing the mapping between integer labels and human-readable names.\\n    *   `self.samples` stores the list of `(path, label)` tuples that `__getitem__` will use.\\n*   **`__len__`:** Simple lookup of the total number of samples stored in `self.samples`.\\n*   **`__getitem__`:**\\n    *   Takes the index `idx`.\\n    *   Retrieves the pre-calculated `img_path` and `label`.\\n    *   Uses `PIL.Image.open()` to load the image file from disk. `.convert('L')` is used because FashionMNIST is grayscale. This ensures the image is in a consistent format before transformations.\\n    *   Applies the `self.transform`. This is crucial because transforms handle conversion to PyTorch tensors (`ToTensor`) and often include resizing, augmentation, or normalization needed for model input.\\n    *   Returns the processed image tensor and the integer label. This is the format `DataLoader` expects: a tensor for the data and a number for the label.\\n\\n**Step 4: Using the Custom Dataset with `DataLoader`**\\n\\nNow we can instantiate our `FashionMNISTFolderDataset` and pass it to a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. The `DataLoader` handles batching, shuffling, and loading data in parallel processes (`num_workers`).\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Optional: for visualization\\nimport numpy as np # Optional: for visualization\\n\\n# --- Usage with DataLoader ---\\n\\n# Define the directory where data was saved (modify if you changed it)\\nDATA_FOLDER_ROOT = './fashion_mnist_folder'\\n\\n# Define transformations\\n# Common transforms for image data:\\n# 1.

You can now use train_loader and test_loader.\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Reasoning for DataLoader Usage:**\\n\\n*   **Instantiation:** You create instances of your custom `FashionMNISTFolderDataset` for training and testing, applying the desired transformations.\\n*   **`DataLoader(dataset, ...)`:** The `DataLoader` takes the dataset object as its primary argument.\\n*   **`batch_size`:** Specifies how many samples are grouped together in each batch returned by the loader.\\n*   **`shuffle=True`:** Important for training data to randomize the order of samples across epochs, helping the model generalize better. `shuffle=False` is typical for validation/testing.\\n*   **`num_workers`:** Controls how many subprocesses are used for data loading. `0` means the data loading is done in the main process. Using a small number (like 2 or 4) can speed up loading by fetching the next batch while the current one is being processed on the GPU, but setting it too high can consume excessive CPU/memory.\\n*   **Iteration:** You typically iterate through the `DataLoader` in your training loop (`for images, labels in train_loader:`). Each iteration yields a batch of image tensors and a batch of label tensors, ready to be passed to your model.\\n*   **`next(iter(train_loader))`:** A common way to get just *one* batch for inspection, as shown in the example.\\n\\n**Summary of the Full Process:**\\n\\n1.  **(One-time Setup)** Run the `save_fashion_mnist_to_folder()` function to download the original FashionMNIST data and save it as individual image files within a class-based folder structure.\\n2.  Define the `FashionMNISTFolderDataset` class, inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. Implement `__init__`, `__len__`, and `__getitem__` to read from the created folder structure.\\n3.  Define any necessary `torchvision.transforms`.\\n4.  Instantiate the `FashionMNISTFolderDataset`, providing the root folder path, split (train/test), and transforms.\\n5.  Instantiate `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, passing the dataset object, desired batch size, shuffle option, and number of workers.\\n6.  Use the `DataLoader` instances (e.g., `train_loader`, `test_loader`) in your training and evaluation loops.\\n\\nThis setup effectively demonstrates how to handle datasets that are stored as loose files in a directory structure, providing a flexible pattern applicable to many real-world image datasets.\",\n          \"Okay, let's create a Python function using TensorFlow to train a simple linear regression model on the California Housing dataset. We'll go through the steps: loading data, preparing it, defining the model, compiling it, and training it.\\n\\n**Step-by-step Reasoning and Code Generation:**\\n\\n1.  **Import necessary libraries:** We need TensorFlow for the model, `tensorflow_datasets` to load the dataset easily, and scikit-learn for data splitting and scaling (common preprocessing steps).\\n\\n    ```python\\n    import tensorflow as tf\\n    import tensorflow_datasets as tfds\\n    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\\n    import numpy as np\\n    ```\\n    *   `tensorflow`: The core library.\\n    *   `tensorflow_datasets`: Provides convenient access to many standard datasets like California Housing.\\n    *   `train_test_split`: Essential for dividing our data into a set for training the model and a separate set for evaluating it. This prevents overfitting.\\n    *   `StandardScaler`: A standard preprocessing step for numerical data. It scales features to have zero mean and unit variance, which often helps optimization algorithms (like the one used in training) converge faster and perform better.\\n    *   `numpy`: Useful for handling numerical arrays, which the data will be converted into.\\n\\n2.  **Define the function:** We'll put all the logic inside a function for reusability.\\n\\n    ```python\\n    def train_linear_regression_california_housing(epochs=50, batch_size=32):\\n        # ... rest of the code will go here\\n        pass # Placeholder\\n    ```\\n    *   The function is named descriptively.\\n    *   We add parameters for `epochs` and `batch_size` as these are common hyperparameters for training. Default values are provided.\\n\\n3.  **Load the dataset:** We use `tensorflow_datasets` to load the California Housing dataset. We'll load the 'train' split initially and then manually split it further using scikit-learn, which is often more straightforward for applying preprocessing like scaling.\\n\\n    ```python\\n        # 1. Load the dataset\\n        print(\\\"Loading California Housing dataset...\\\")\\n        ds = tfds.load('california_housing', split='train', as_supervised=False)\\n        print(\\\"Dataset loaded.\\\")\\n    ```\\n    *   `tfds.load('california_housing', ...)`: Loads the dataset by name.\\n    *   `split='train'`: We load the official 'train' split provided by TFDS. Note that the California Housing dataset in TFDS only has a 'train' split, so we'll split this further ourselves.\\n    *   `as_supervised=False`: By default, `as_supervised=True` would return tuples of (features, label). Since the California Housing dataset has multiple features under a single key ('features') and the target ('median_house_value') is separate, `as_supervised=False` returns a dictionary for each example, which is easier to work with here.\\n\\n4.  **Prepare the data (Extract, Convert, Split, Scale):**\\n    *   Convert the `tf.data.Dataset` into NumPy arrays.\\n    *   Separate features (X) and target (y).\\n    *   Split into training and testing sets.\\n    *   Scale the features.\\n\\n    ```python\\n        # 2.

It's crucial *not* to fit the scaler on the test data to avoid data leakage.\\n\\n5.  **Define the model:** A simple linear regression model can be represented by a single `Dense` layer with one unit and no activation function (or linear activation, which is the default).\\n\\n    ```python\\n        # 3. Define the model\\n        print(\\\"Defining the model...\\\")\\n        # A linear regression model is essentially a single neuron (dense layer with 1 unit)\\n        # with a linear activation function (which is the default).\\n        # The number of input features must match the input data shape.\\n        model = tf.keras.Sequential([\\n            tf.keras.layers.Dense(\\n                units=1,                  # One output unit for the single regression target\\n                input_shape=(X_train_scaled.shape[1],) # Input shape is the number of features\\n            )\\n        ])\\n        print(\\\"Model defined.\\\")\\n        model.summary()\\n    ```\\n    *   `tf.keras.Sequential([...])`: Creates a sequential model, which is a stack of layers.\\n    *   `tf.keras.layers.Dense(...)`: A fully connected layer.\\n    *   `units=1`: This layer has one neuron, which will produce a single output (our predicted house value).\\n    *   `input_shape=(X_train_scaled.shape[1],)`: Tells the first layer the expected shape of the input data. `X_train_scaled.shape[1]` gives the number of features. The comma is important to indicate it's a tuple representing the shape of *one* input sample (e.g., `(8,)` for 8 features).\\n    *   `model.summary()`: Prints a summary of the model's layers and parameters. For this model, the parameters will be `num_features * 1` (weights) + `1` (bias).\\n\\n6.  **Compile the model:** We need to specify the optimizer, the loss function, and any metrics to monitor.\\n\\n    ```python\\n        # 4. Compile the model\\n        print(\\\"Compiling the model...\\\")\\n        # For linear regression:\\n        # Optimizer: Adam is a common and effective choice.

This helps monitor for overfitting (if validation loss starts increasing while training loss decreases).\\n    *   `epochs`: The number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset.\\n    *   `batch_size`: The number of samples processed before the model's weights are updated.\\n    *   `verbose=1`: Displays a progress bar and metrics for each epoch.\\n\\n8.  **Return results:** The function can return the trained model and/or the training history. The history object contains the loss and metric values recorded during training.\\n\\n    ```python\\n        # 6.

We load the 'train' split and keep it in a dictionary format (`as_supervised=False`) initially, as the features and target are separate keys.\\n3.  **Prepare Data:**\\n    *   We convert the TF dataset into NumPy arrays. This is convenient for using Scikit-learn's data preprocessing utilities.\\n    *   We separate the features (`X`) and the target (`y`). The goal of linear regression is to predict `y` from `X`.\\n    *   `train_test_split` divides the data into two subsets: one for training the model (`X_train`, `y_train`) and one for evaluating its performance (`X_test`, `y_test`). This prevents the model from simply memorizing the training data (overfitting). A `random_state` is used to ensure the split is the same every time the code runs.\\n    *   `StandardScaler` is applied to the features. Scaling brings all features to a similar range (mean 0, variance 1). This is important for gradient-based optimizers like Adam, as it can help them converge faster and more stably, especially when features have different scales. It's fitted *only* on the training data (`fit_transform`) to learn the scaling parameters, and then these parameters are applied to both training and test data (`transform`) to avoid data leakage from the test set into the training process.\\n4.  **Define Model:**\\n    *   We use `tf.keras.Sequential` because our model is a simple linear stack of layers.\\n    *   The model consists of a single `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer.\\n    *   `units=1`: A `Dense` layer with one unit calculates a weighted sum of its inputs plus a bias term (`output = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wn*xn + b`). This is exactly the form of a simple linear regression equation.\\n    *   `input_shape=(X_train_scaled.shape[1],)`: This tells the layer how many input features to expect for each sample. `X_train_scaled.shape[1]` is the number of columns (features) in our scaled training data.\\n    *   The `activation` is by default 'linear', which is correct for linear regression (we don't want to apply a non-linear transformation to the output).\\n5.  **Compile Model:**\\n    *   `model.compile` prepares the model for the training process.\\n    *   `optimizer='adam'`: We choose the Adam optimizer. It's an efficient and widely used algorithm for updating the model's weights based on the training data and the calculated loss.\\n    *   `loss='mse'`: We select Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. This is the standard loss for regression problems. The training process aims to minimize the average of the squared differences between the model's predictions and the actual target values.\\n    *   `metrics=['mae', 'mse']`: We specify Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and MSE as metrics to monitor. Metrics are displayed during training but *not* used to optimize the model (only the loss function is used for optimization). MAE is often easier to interpret than MSE as it's in the same units as the target variable.\\n6.  **Train Model:**\\n    *   `model.fit` starts the training loop.\\n    *   `X_train_scaled` and `y_train` are the input and output data used to train the model.\\n    *   `validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test)` provides the test set to evaluate the model's performance after each training epoch. This helps monitor if the model is learning well or starting to overfit (validation loss increases).\\n    *   `epochs` is the number of times the training algorithm iterates through the entire training dataset.\\n    *   `batch_size` determines how many samples are processed at a time within each epoch before the model's weights are updated.\\n    *   `verbose=1` displays training progress.\\n7.  **Return Results:** The function returns the trained `model` object, which can be used for making predictions, and the `history` object, which contains the recorded loss and metric values per epoch for both training and validation sets.\\n\\nThis function provides a clear and well-structured way to perform a simple linear regression task using TensorFlow on a common dataset, following standard machine learning practices like data splitting and scaling.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"few_shot_gemini\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Okay, here is a complete Python script using PyTorch to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\\n\\nThis script covers:\\n1.  **Imports:** Necessary libraries.\\n2.  **Device Configuration:** Checks for CUDA availability.\\n3.  **Hyperparameters:** Sets learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc.\\n4.  **Data Loading:** Downloads and loads CIFAR-10 with appropriate transformations.\\n5.  **Model Definition:** Defines a simple CNN architecture.\\n6.  **Loss Function and Optimizer:** Sets up `CrossEntropyLoss` and `Adam` optimizer.\\n7.  **Training Loop:** Iterates through epochs, performs forward/backward passes, and updates weights.\\n8.  **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model on the test set after training.\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torch.optim as optim\\nimport torchvision\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # For optional plotting\\n\\n# --- 1.

It's crucial to move your model and data tensors to the correct device.\\n3.  **Hyperparameters:** Essential parameters like the number of training epochs, batch size, learning rate, and dataset-specific values like the number of classes and input channels are defined.\\n4.  **Data Loading:**\\n    *   `transforms.Compose` chains multiple transformations together. `ToTensor()` converts PIL Images or NumPy arrays to PyTorch tensors (scaling pixel values to \\\\[0, 1]). `Normalize` scales the pixel values to a range around zero (here, \\\\[-1, 1]) using the mean and standard deviation for each channel.\\n    *   `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10` downloads (if not already present) and loads the CIFAR-10 dataset. `train=True` gets the training set, `train=False` gets the test set.\\n    *   `DataLoader` wraps the dataset to provide an iterable over batches. `shuffle=True` for the training loader is important for better training.\\n5.  **Model Definition (`SimpleCNN`):**\\n    *   This class inherits from `nn.Module`.\\n    *   The `__init__` method defines the layers:\\n        *   `nn.Conv2d`: Performs convolution. `in_channels` is the number of input feature maps (3 for RGB). `out_channels` is the number of feature maps produced by this layer. `kernel_size` is the filter size. `padding=1` with `kernel_size=3` and `stride=1` helps maintain the spatial dimensions after convolution.\\n        *   `nn.ReLU`: The Rectified Linear Unit activation function, applied after each convolutional layer.\\n        *   `nn.MaxPool2d`: Downsamples the spatial dimensions (height and width). `kernel_size=2` and `stride=2` is standard for halving the dimensions.\\n        *   `nn.Linear`: A fully connected layer. The input size is calculated based on the output dimensions and feature maps from the last pooling layer. `128 * 4 * 4` comes from 128 output channels of `conv3` and spatial dimensions of `4x4` after the last pooling layer.\\n    *   The `forward` method defines how data flows through the network: it applies the layers sequentially, flattens the tensor before the linear layers, and returns the raw output (logits).\\n6.  **Loss and Optimizer:**\\n    *   `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` is used because it combines the Softmax activation and the negative log-likelihood loss, which is suitable for multi-class classification.\\n    *   `optim.Adam` is a popular optimization algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the calculated gradients. We pass the model's parameters and the learning rate.\\n7.  **Training Loop:**\\n    *   The outer loop iterates through epochs.\\n    *   `model.train()` sets the model to training mode (enables features like dropout if used, though not in this simple model).\\n    *   The inner loop iterates through batches provided by the `train_loader`.\\n    *   Data and labels are moved to the specified `device`.\\n    *   A forward pass (`model(images)`) computes the predictions.\\n    *   The `criterion` calculates the loss between predictions and true labels.\\n    *   `optimizer.zero_grad()` clears gradients from the previous batch.\\n    *   `loss.backward()` computes gradients for all parameters w.r.t. the loss.\\n    *   `optimizer.step()` updates the model parameters using the gradients and the optimizer's rules.\\n8.  **Evaluation:**\\n    *   `model.eval()` sets the model to evaluation mode (disables features like dropout, ensures batch normalization uses global stats if present).\\n    *   `with torch.no_grad():` disables gradient calculation, which saves memory and speeds up computation during evaluation since we don't need to backpropagate.\\n    *   The loop iterates through the `test_loader`.\\n    *   Predictions are made. `torch.max(outputs.data, 1)` returns the maximum value and its index along dimension 1 (the class dimension). The index is the predicted class.\\n    *   `total` and `correct` counters are updated to calculate the overall accuracy.\\n    *   The test accuracy is printed after each epoch.\\n\\nThis script provides a solid foundation for training CNNs on image classification tasks like CIFAR-10. You can extend it by adding more complex layers (like Batch Normalization, Dropout), implementing learning rate scheduling, or saving the best model checkpoint.\",\n          \"Okay, you've provided examples of a custom dataset class loading from files/CSV and another custom dataset class loading synthetic data.\\n\\nFor the FashionMNIST dataset, PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets` module already provides a `Dataset` subclass specifically designed to load this dataset. It handles downloading the data (if needed) and parsing the files. So, the standard approach is to use this built-in class rather than writing a *new* custom class from scratch to parse the FashionMNIST files yourself.\\n\\nHere's how you use the existing `torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST` class with a `DataLoader`:\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader # Dataset is implicitly used by FashionMNIST\\nimport torchvision\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# --- Configuration ---\\nBATCH_SIZE = 64\\n# Directory to save/load the dataset files\\nDATA_DIR = './data'\\n\\n# --- Transformations ---\\n# FashionMNIST images are PIL images.

When you instantiate it, you point it to a directory (`root`), specify whether you want the training or test split (`train=True`), tell it to download the data if it's not found (`download=True`), and provide any transformations (`transform`). It handles all the details of loading the image and label files.\\n2.  **`transforms.ToTensor()`:** FashionMNIST images are loaded as PIL Images by `torchvision.datasets`. Neural networks work with tensors. `ToTensor()` is a crucial transform that converts a PIL Image or NumPy array (`H x W x C`) into a PyTorch Tensor (`C x H x W`) and automatically scales the pixel values from [0, 255] (uint8) to [0.0, 1.0] (float32).\\n3.  **`DataLoader`:** You then wrap the `train_dataset` object (which is an instance of the `FashionMNIST` `Dataset` subclass) in a `DataLoader`. You specify the `batch_size`, whether to `shuffle` the data (important for training to prevent the model from learning the order), and `num_workers` (how many separate processes to use for data loading, which can speed up fetching batches).\\n4.  **Iteration:** The `DataLoader` becomes an iterable. You can loop through it (e.g., `for images, labels in train_dataloader:`) to get batches of data and labels that are ready to be fed into a PyTorch model.\\n\\nThis is the standard and efficient way to work with well-known datasets like FashionMNIST in PyTorch. You don't need to write a *new* `Dataset` class from scratch unless you are working with a custom dataset that `torchvision.datasets` doesn't cover.\",\n          \"Okay, here is the Python function using TensorFlow/Keras to create, compile, and train a simple linear regression model on the California Housing dataset, including a normalization layer and one dense layer.\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\nfrom tensorflow import keras\\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler # Optional: alternative to Keras Normalization\\n\\ndef create_and_train_california_housing_model():\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Creates, compiles, and trains a simple linear regression model\\n    with a Normalization layer and one Dense layer on the California\\n    Housing dataset.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        tuple: A tuple containing the trained Keras model and\\n               the training history object.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    print(\\\"Loading California Housing dataset...\\\")\\n    # Load the dataset\\n    # as_frame=True loads it into a pandas DataFrame\\n    housing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)\\n    X, y = housing.data, housing.target\\n\\n    print(f\\\"Dataset loaded.

We separate features (`X`) and target (`y`).\\n4.  **Split Data:** `train_test_split` divides the data into training and testing sets. It's crucial to evaluate the final model on data it hasn't seen during training.\\n5.  **Normalization Layer:** `layers.Normalization` is created. `input_shape` is set to `[X_train.shape[1],]` because the California Housing dataset has 8 features, and we are feeding all of them to the model. `axis=-1` ensures each feature is normalized independently. `normalizer.adapt(X_train)` calculates the necessary statistics (mean and variance) *only* from the training data.\\n6.  **Model Definition:** A `keras.Sequential` model is created. It contains two layers:\\n    *   The `normalizer` layer takes the raw input features and outputs their normalized versions.\\n    *   A `layers.Dense(units=1)` layer takes the normalized features and computes a single output value using a linear transformation (`output = sum(weights * inputs) + bias`). This single dense layer with one output unit *is* the core of the linear regression model.\\n7.  **Compile Model:**\\n    *   `optimizer='adam'` (or `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=...)`) is a popular and usually effective optimizer.\\n    *   `loss='mean_squared_error'` is the standard loss function for linear regression problems (minimizing MSE is equivalent to maximizing likelihood under the assumption of Gaussian noise).\\n8.  **Train Model:** `model.fit()` performs the training.\\n    *   `X_train`, `y_train`: The data to train on.\\n    *   `epochs=100`: The model iterates through the training data 100 times.\\n    *   `verbose=1`: Prints progress during training.\\n    *   `validation_split=0.2`: Automatically holds back 20% of the *training data* to use as a validation set. The model is *not* trained on this portion, but the loss on this portion is calculated and reported at the end of each epoch, which helps monitor for overfitting.\\n9.  **Evaluate (Optional):** `model.evaluate()` calculates the loss on the separate `X_test`, `y_test` set. This gives a final, unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.\\n10. **Predict (Optional):** `model.predict()` generates predictions for new input data (here, the first 5 test samples).\\n\\nThis script effectively implements a simple linear regression model using the Keras API, including the recommended practice of normalizing input features.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Stanford NLP/step2-responses.csv')\n","df"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['direct_response_gpt'][7]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":161},"id":"6Rau6cMDmbhG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749002030187,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Neeharika Gupta","userId":"13434636909198909500"}},"outputId":"c472d642-4999-48f9-aac4-a9ba10d02f28"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'```java\\nimport java.io.IOException;\\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.io.Text;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Job;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Mapper;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Reducer;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat;\\nimport org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat;\\n\\npublic class WordCount {\\n\\n    public static class TokenizerMapper\\n        extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable>{\\n\\n        private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);\\n        private Text word = new Text();\\n\\n        public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context\\n                        ) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\\n            StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());\\n            while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {\\n                word.set(itr.nextToken());\\n                context.write(word, one);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static class IntSumReducer\\n        extends Reducer<Text,IntWritable,Text,IntWritable> {\\n        private IntWritable result = new IntWritable();\\n\\n        public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values,\\n                           Context context\\n                           ) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\\n            int sum = 0;\\n            for (IntWritable val : values) {\\n                sum += val.get();\\n            }\\n            result.set(sum);\\n            context.write(key, result);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\\n        Configuration conf = new Configuration();\\n        Job job = Job.getInstance(conf, \"word count\");\\n        job.setJarByClass(WordCount.class);\\n        job.setMapperClass(TokenizerMapper.class);\\n        job.setCombinerClass(IntSumReducer.class);\\n        job.setReducerClass(IntSumReducer.class);\\n        job.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);\\n        job.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);\\n        FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(args[0]));\\n        FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(args[1]));\\n        System.exit(job.waitForCompletion(true) ?
